**...what would you love to go into work and do every day?**

I see myself creating apps for both Andriod and IOS Apps. I want to be able to provide the youth with happies through apps on a new level of interaction, similar to PokemonGo/ Arugumentive Reality (AR). Being able to go to work everyday, and creating my wildest idea into a reality is something that excites me. I can wait to be at that level.
